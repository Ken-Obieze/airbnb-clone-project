## 🚀 Objective

Provide a solid foundation for user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments, exposing clean REST and GraphQL APIs and supporting operational needs like observability, security, and CI/CD.

---

## 🏆 Project Goals

* **User Management**: Secure registration, authentication, and profile management.
* **Property Management**: Create, update, search, and retrieve property listings.
* **Booking System**: Reserve properties with availability checks and lifecycle management.
* **Payment Processing**: Process and record transactions safely and idempotently.
* **Review System**: Post moderated reviews and ratings.
* **Data Optimization**: Fast reads via indexing, caching, and pagination.

## 🛠️ Features Overview

### 1) API Documentation

* **OpenAPI**: REST endpoints documented for easy client consumption.
* **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Batteries‑included REST CRUD.
* **GraphQL**: Flexible data fetching for web and mobile clients.

### 2) User Authentication

* **Endpoints**: `/users/`, `/users/{user_id}/`
* **Features**: Sign‑up, login, JWT issuance/refresh, profile CRUD.

### 3) Property Management

* **Endpoints**: `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`
* **Features**: CRUD, search, filtering (price, location, amenities), availability.

### 4) Booking System

* **Endpoints**: `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`
* **Features**: Create/modify/cancel bookings; check‑in/out; prevent overlaps.

### 5) Payment Processing

* **Endpoints**: `/payments/`
* **Features**: Capture/confirm/refund; webhook handling; idempotency.

### 6) Review System

* **Endpoints**: `/reviews/`, `/reviews/{review_id}/`
* **Features**: Post/edit/delete reviews; rating aggregation; moderation flags.

### 7) Database Optimizations

* **Indexing**: Hot paths (users.email, properties.host\_id, bookings.date ranges).
* **Caching**: Redis for hot listings, search results, and derived aggregates.

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

* **Django**: High‑level web framework and ORM.
* **Django REST Framework**: REST API layer (auth, pagination, throttling, serializers).
* **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational datastore with advanced features (indices, constraints, JSONB, GIST/GIN).
* **GraphQL (Graphene or Strawberry)**: Flexible data access; avoids over/under‑fetching.
* **Celery**: Async background jobs (emails, webhooks, payment reconciliation).
* **Redis**: Task broker & cache (rate limiting, sessions, query caching).
* **Docker**: Dev/prod parity via containers.
* **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub Actions for lint/test/build/migrate/deploy.

## 👥 Team Roles

> Inspired by the project overview and standard SDLC role definitions.

* **Backend Developer**: Designs domain models; implements REST/GraphQL endpoints, business logic, validations; writes tests; handles performance profiling.
* **Database Administrator (DBA)**: Owns schema evolution, indexing strategy, backups, PITR, and performance tuning.
* **DevOps Engineer**: Builds CI/CD, container orchestration, observability (logs/metrics/traces), scaling, and secret management.
* **QA Engineer**: Test plans, automated API/UI tests, regression suites, load tests, and release sign‑off.
* **Security Engineer** *(optional/overlapping)*: Threat modeling, dependency scanning, secret rotation, incident response.
* **Product Manager** *(optional)*: Requirements, prioritization, roadmap, and acceptance criteria.
